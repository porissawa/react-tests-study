# React Test study + notes

**Run yarn/npm start to start the dev server.**

**Run yarn/npm run test to run the tests.**

**To keep in mind:**

All tests are inside src/components/\_\_tests\_\_

The import path for project imports are possible because of the jsconfig.json file in the root directory.

Enzyme can only be used after setting it up, which happens in the src/setupTests.js file (which should always be names exactly like this).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
